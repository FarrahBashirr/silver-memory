honestly futile if i don't utilize what i do though for good at least once in a while so i wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch i scribble and doodle enough rhymes to maybe try to help get some people through tough times but i gotta keep a few punchlines just in case 'cause even you unsigned rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime i know there was a time where once i was king of the underground but i still rap like i'm on my pharoahe monch grind so i crunch rhymes but sometimes when you combine appeal with the skin color of mine you get too big and here they come tryin' to censor you like that one line i said on i'm back from the mathers lp  when i tried to say i'll take seven kids from columbine put 'em all in a line add an ak47 a revolver and a 9 see if i

levitating never fading and i know the haters are forever waiting for the day that they can say i fell off they'll be celebrating 'cause i know the way to get 'em motivated i make elevating music you make elevator music oh he's too mainstream well that's what they do when they get jealous they confuse it it's not hiphop it's pop'cause i found a hella way to fuse it with rock shock rap with doc

versus you it's curtains i'm inadvertently hurtin' you how many verses i gotta murder to prove that if you were half as nice your songs you could sacrifice virgins too ugh school flunky pill junkie but look at the accolades these skills brung me full of myself but still hungry i bully myself 'cause i make me do what i put my mind to and i'm a million leagues above you ill when i speak in tongues but it's still tongueincheek fuck you i'm drunk so satan take the fucking wheel i'ma sleep in the front seat bumpin' heavy d and the boyz still chunky but funky but in my head there's something i can feel tugging and struggling angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me they're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred i have then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation and understand the discrimination but fuck it life's handin' you lemons make lemonade then but if i can't batter the women how the fuck am i supposed to bake them a cake then don't mistake him for satan it's a fatal mistake if you think i need to be overseas and take a vacation to trip a broad and make her fall on her face

you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get revival but y'all are actin' like i tried to serve you up a slider maybe the vocals shoulda been autotuned and you woulda bought it but sayin' i no longer got it 'cause you missed a line and never caught it 'cause it went over your head because you're too stupid to get it 'cause you're mentally retarded but pretend to be the smartest with your expertise and knowledge but you'll never be an artist and i'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless what i'll never be is flawless all i'll ever be is honest illa illa illa even when i'm gone they're gonna say i brought it even when i hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic with a bottle full of malt liquor but i couldn't bottle this shit any longer the fact that i know that i'ma hit my bottom if i don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet i don't see why y'all even started with me i get in beefs my enemies die i don't cease fire 'til at least all are deceased

like a one a day i'm not done preach 'cause i feel like the beast of burden that line in the sand was it even worth it 'cause the way i see people turning's makin' it seem worthless it's startin' to defeat the purpose i'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds and i was just tryin' to do the right thing but word has the court of public opinion reached a verdict or still yet to be determined 'cause i'm determined to be me critiqued or worshipped but if i could go back i'd at least reword it and say i empathize with the people this evil serpent sold the dream to that he's deserted but i think it's workin' these verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous and he's too scurred to answer me with words 'cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered but i know at least he's heard it 'cause agent orange just sent the secret service to meet in person to see if i really think of hurtin' him or ask if i'm linked to terrorists i said only when it comes to ink and lyricists but my beef is more media journalists hold up hold up hold up i said my beef is more meaty a journalist can get a mouthful of flesh and yes i mean eating a penis 'cause they've been pannin' my album to death so i've

guy follow me i ruhuhun follow me i ruhuhun   i've been driving around your side of this town like 9 fricking hours and 45 minutes now finally i found your new address park in your drive feel like i've been waiting on this moment all of my life and it's now arrived and my mouth is full of saliva my knife is out and i'm ducking on the side of your house see it's sad it came to this point such a disappointment i had to make this appointment to come and see ya but i ain't here for your empathy i don't need your apology or your friendship or sympathy it's revenge that i seek so i sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window like i reach my full potentiali peeked continue to peep still bent low then keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo sneak all the way 'round to the back porch man door handles unlocked shouldn't be that easy to do this you don't plan for intruders beforehand surprised to see me cat got your tongue gag chloroform rag dag almost hackup a lung like you picked an axe up and swung stick to the core plan dragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fans irony's spectacular huh now who's a faggot you punk and here's your bronco hat you can have that shit back cause they suck it's just me you and the music now slim i hope you hear it we're in a car right now  wait here comes my favorite lyric i'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die and hey here's a sequel to my mathers lp just to try to get people to buy how's this for a publicity stunt this should be fun last album now cause after this you'll be officially done eminem killed by m and m matthew mitchell bitch i even have your initials i initially was gonna bury you next to my brother but fuck it since you're in love with your city so much i figured what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here two more exits time is quite near hope we don't get stopped no license i fear that sirens i hear guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea as cops appear in my driver's side mirror oh god police aaaghh hope foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot at least new plan stan slim chauvinist pig drove in this big lincoln town car well gotta go almost at the  ha ha big bro it's for you slim this is for him and frank ocean oh hope you can swim good now say you hate homos again  part  produced by streetrunner  4 i also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend i'm the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in i'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin nope it's hopeless i'm the denial that you're hopelessly in when they say all of this is approaching its end but you refuse to believe that it's over here we go all over again back's to the wall i'm stacking up all them odds toilets clogged yeah cause i'm talking a lot of shit but i'm backing it all up but in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers after the track is demolished i am your lack of a conscience i'm the ringing in your ears i'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils eating your vocal cords after your concerts i'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged grab for some water but i'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow i'm the bullies you hate that you became with every faggot you slaughtered coming back on ya every woman you insult batter but the doublestandard you have when it comes to your daughters i represent everything you take for granted cause marshall mathers the rapper's persona is half a facade and matthew and stan's just symbolic of you not knowing what you had 'til it's gone cause after all the glitz and the glam no more fans that are calling your name cameras are off sad but it happens to all of them i'm the hindsight to say i told you so foreshadows of all the things that are to follow i'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow if you don't stop after they call ya biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits when it's time to walk away i'm every guilt trip the baggage you have but as you gather up all your possessions if there's anything you have left to say 'less it makes an impact then don't bother so 'fore you rest your case better make sure you're packing a wallop so one last time i'm back 'fore it fades into black and it's all over behold the final chapter in a saga tryna recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle twice the magic that started it all tragic portrait of an artist tortured trapped in his own drawings tap into thoughts blacker and darker than anything imaginable here goes a wild stab in the dark uh as we pick up where the last mathers left off,05/11/2013,Energetic
